## Clay

[![CodeQL](https://github.com/unattended-backpack/clay/actions/workflows/codeql.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/unattended-backpack/clay/actions/workflows/codeql.yml) [![Create Release](https://github.com/unattended-backpack/clay/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/unattended-backpack/clay/actions/workflows/release.yml)

> We are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.

Clay is a template repository from which we may create new projects.

## Building

To build locally, you should simply need to run `make`; you can see more in the [`Makefile`](./Makefile). This will default to building with the maintainer-provided details from [`.env.maintainer`](./.env.maintainer), which we will periodically update as details change.

You can also build container images using `make docker`, which uses a `BUILD_IMAGE` for building dependencies that are packaged to run in a `RUNTIME_IMAGE`. Configuration values in `.env.maintainer` may be overridden by specifying them as environment variables, including specific image names.
```bash
CLAY_NAME=clay POTTER_NAME=potter make docker
BUILD_IMAGE=registry.digitalocean.com/sigil/petros:latest make build
RUNTIME_IMAGE=debian:bookworm-slim@sha256:... make build
```

## Configuration

Our configuration follows a zero-trust model where all sensitive configuration is stored on the self-hosted runner, not in GitHub. This section documents the configuration required for automated releases via GitHub Actions.

Running this project may require some sensitive configuration to be provided in `.env` and other files; you can generate the configuration files from the provided examples with `make init`. Review configuration files carefully and populate all required fields before proceeding.

### Runner-Local Secrets

All automated build secrets must be stored on the self-hosted runner at `/opt/github-runner/secrets/`. These files are mounted read-only into the release workflow container; they are never stored in git.

#### Required Secrets

**GitHub Access Tokens** (for creating releases and pushing to GHCR):
- `ci_gh_pat` - A GitHub fine-grained personal access token with repository permissions.
- `ci_gh_classic_pat` - A GitHub classic personal access token for GHCR authentication.

**Registry Access Tokens** (for pushing container images):
- `do_token` - A DigitalOcean API token with container registry write access.
- `dh_token` - A Docker Hub access token.

**GPG Signing Keys** (for signing release artifacts):
- `gpg_private_key` - A base64-encoded GPG private key for signing digests.
- `gpg_passphrase` - The passphrase for the GPG private key.
- `gpg_public_key` - The base64-encoded GPG public key (included in release notes).

**Registry Configuration** (`registry.env` file):

This file contains non-sensitive registry identifiers and build configuration:

```bash
# The Docker image to perform release builds with.
# If not set, defaults to unattended/petros:latest from Docker Hub.
# Examples:
#   BUILD_IMAGE=registry.digitalocean.com/sigil/petros:latest
#   BUILD_IMAGE=ghcr.io/your-org/petros:latest
#   BUILD_IMAGE=unattended/petros:latest
BUILD_IMAGE=unattended/petros:latest

# The runtime base image for the final container.
# If not set, uses the value from from .env.maintainer.
# Example:
#   RUNTIME_IMAGE=debian:trixie-slim@sha256:66b37a5078a77098bfc80175fb5eb881a3196809242fd295b25502854e12cbec
RUNTIME_IMAGE=debian:trixie-slim@sha256:66b37a5078a77098bfc80175fb5eb881a3196809242fd295b25502854e12cbec

# The name of the DigitalOcean registry to publish the built image to.
DO_REGISTRY_NAME=

# The username of the Docker Hub account to publish the built image to.
DH_USERNAME=unattended
```

### Public Configuration

Public configuration that anyone building this project needs is stored in the repository at [`.env.maintainer`](./.env.maintainer):

- `CLAY_NAME` - The published name for the Clay Docker image.
- `POTTER_NAME` - The published name for the Potter Docker image.
- `BUILD_IMAGE` - The builder image for compiling Rust code (default: `unattended/petros:latest`).
- `RUNTIME_IMAGE` - The runtime base image (default: pinned `debian:trixie-slim@sha256:...`).

This file is version-controlled and updated by maintainers as infrastructure details change.

## Verifying Release Artifacts

All releases include GPG-signed artifacts for verification. Each release contains:

- `image-digests.txt` - A human-readable list of all container image digests.
- `image-digests.txt.asc` - A GPG signature for the digest list.
- Per-image manifests and signatures for each built image:
  - `<image>-ghcr-manifest.json` / `<image>-ghcr-manifest.json.asc` - GitHub Container Registry OCI manifest and signature.
  - `<image>-dh-manifest.json` / `<image>-dh-manifest.json.asc` - Docker Hub OCI manifest and signature.
  - `<image>-do-manifest.json` / `<image>-do-manifest.json.asc` - DigitalOcean Container Registry OCI manifest and signature.

### Quick Verification

Download the artifacts and verify signatures:

```bash
# Import the GPG public key (base64-encoded in release notes).
echo "<GPG_PUBLIC_KEY>" | base64 -d | gpg --import

# Verify digest list.
gpg --verify image-digests.txt.asc image-digests.txt

# Verify image manifests for each image.
gpg --verify <image>-ghcr-manifest.json.asc <image>-ghcr-manifest.json
gpg --verify <image>-dh-manifest.json.asc <image>-dh-manifest.json
gpg --verify <image>-do-manifest.json.asc <image>-do-manifest.json
```

### Manifest Verification

The manifest files contain the complete OCI image structure (layers, config, metadata). You can use these to verify that a registry hasn't tampered with an image.
```bash
# Pull the manifest from the registry.
docker manifest inspect ghcr.io/unattended-backpack/...@sha256:... \
  --verbose > registry-manifest.json

# Compare to the signed manifest.
diff ghcr-manifest.json registry-manifest.json
```

This provides cryptographic proof that the image structure (all layers and configuration) matches what was signed at release time.

### Cosign Verification

Images are also signed with [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) using GitHub Actions OIDC for keyless signing. This provides automated verification and build provenance.

To verify with cosign:
```bash
# Verify image signature (proves it was built by our workflow).
cosign verify ghcr.io/unattended-backpack/...@sha256:... \
  --certificate-identity-regexp='^https://github.com/unattended-backpack/.+' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```

Cosign verification provides:
- Automated verification (no manual GPG key management).
- Build provenance (proves image was built by the GitHub Actions workflow).
- Registry-native signatures (stored alongside images).

**Note**: Cosign depends on external infrastructure (GitHub OIDC, Rekor). For maximum trust independence, rely on the GPG-signed manifests as your ultimate root of trust.

## Local Testing

This repository is configured to support testing the release workflow locally using the `act` tool. There is a corresponding goal in the Makefile, and instructions for further management of secrets [here](./docs/WORKFLOW_TESTING.md). This local testing file also shows how to configure the required secrets for building.
